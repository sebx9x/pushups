# Chapter 2: Push-Ups Basics

Push-ups are a simple yet powerful bodyweight exercise that builds strength in your chest, shoulders, triceps, and core.

## How to Do a Proper Push-Up

1. Start in a plank position — hands under shoulders, body in a straight line.
2. Lower your chest toward the floor by bending your elbows.
3. Keep your core tight and back flat.
4. Push back up until your arms are straight.

## Tips for Beginners

- Can’t do full push-ups yet? Start with **knee push-ups** or **incline push-ups** (hands on a bench).
- Focus on **quality over quantity** — full range of motion matters more than high reps.

## Quick Challenge

Try this:
- 3 sets of 5–10 push-ups
- Rest 60 seconds between sets
