# Chapter 1: Push-Ups Exercise

Welcome to the first chapter of "Bodyweight Basics for Beginners." In this chapter, we’ll explore one of the most iconic and effective bodyweight exercises: the **push-up**. Often underestimated, push-ups are a powerhouse move that builds upper body strength, core stability, and muscular endurance. Whether you're working out at home, in the gym, or on the go, mastering the push-up sets the foundation for countless strength-based progressions.

## Understanding Push-Ups

### Definition of a Push-Up

A push-up is a **compound bodyweight exercise** that primarily targets the **chest (pectorals), shoulders (deltoids), triceps**, and **core**.

- **Core Idea**: Push-ups use your own bodyweight as resistance to build strength and control.
- **Analogy**: Think of a push-up like a moving plank — you maintain tight core alignment while pressing away from the floor.

### Benefits of Push-Ups

Push-ups aren’t just for beginners — they're scalable and offer a range of benefits:

- **Functional Strength**: Mimics real-world movements like pushing or bracing.
- **Muscle Activation**: Engages multiple upper body and core muscle groups.
- **No Equipment Needed**: All you need is your body and a flat surface.
- **Scalability**: Easy to modify for both beginners and advanced athletes.

Example:

```python
# Representing a basic push-up workout routine in Python

def pushup_workout(sets, reps):
    for s in range(1, sets + 1):
        print(f"Set {s}: Do {reps} push-ups")

# Example: 3 sets of 10 push-ups
pushup_workout(3, 10)
