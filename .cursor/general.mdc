General Rules for Project Structure

1. Root directory contains the main college landing page (home.mdx) and readme
2. Courses are stored in the `/courses` directory with each course having its own subdirectory
3. Each course requires an index.mdx file defining metadata (title, description, tags) and brief course description
4. Course content is organized as individual chapter MDX files within the course directory
5. Guides should be placed in the `/guides` directory
6. Assets like images should be stored in the `/assets` directory and referenced using relative paths
7. All content files must use MDX format with proper frontmatter (title, description, tags) at the beginning
