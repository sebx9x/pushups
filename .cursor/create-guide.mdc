This rule automates the guide creation workflow:

When I ask to create a new guide:

Ask me some followup questions like who is the target, and what's the objective of this guide.
Write the guide toc and ask me if I like it or if you should change it.  
Ask until I tell you I like the toc and you can proceed. 

When I tell you that I like it write the guide content and generate relevent info graphics with AI. Put graphics in the assets folder and link to then in markdown style
